    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a child, I believed design was just about drawing and lettering—a way to make things look beautiful. But over time, I realized it’s so much more. Design is visual storytelling—a tool to shape experiences, build connections, and bring ideas to life in ways that truly helps.</p>

    <p>My journey started with editorial design, where I became fascinated by how typography and composition guide readers through immersive narratives. Growing up in a time when digital was rapidly overtaking analog, and the internet became the "sun" of our connected world, I found myself at the intersection of two worlds. That curiosity led me to UX/UI design, where I discovered the power of creating seamless, intuitive digital experiences.</p>

    <p>No matter the medium—whether it’s a meticulously crafted print publication or a responsive digital interface—my goal remains the same: to simplify complexity, amplify voices, and create human-centered designs that leave a lasting impact.</p>

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    <p>I specialize in two key areas, where design goes beyond aesthetics to create meaningful experiences:</p>
    <h3>Editorial Design</h3>
    <p>Books, magazines, and newspapers are more than just printed words—they are carefully composed narratives. Through thoughtful typography, layout, and publication design, I help self-published authors, small businesses, and educators tell their stories with clarity and elegance, ensuring their message is both captivating and impactful.</p>
    <h3>UX/UI Design</h3>
    <p>I design interactive, user-centered digital experiences for apps and websites. By leveraging design systems, prototypes, and responsive principles, I help businesses and creators turn their ideas into seamless, intuitive interfaces that engage and empower users.</p>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>Every project I take on is a chapter in a larger story. My process blends creativity with a structured methodology based on the Product Development Life Cycle, ensuring that each design is both functional and meaningful:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Brainstorming – Collaborating to generate ideas and align goals.</li>
        <li>Define – Identifying challenges and setting clear objectives.</li>
        <li>Design – Creating wireframes, prototypes, and layouts to develop intuitive solutions.</li>
        <li>Test – Gathering feedback to refine and enhance user experiences.</li>
        <li>Launch – Delivering polished, purpose-driven designs that leave a lasting impact.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This iterative process ensures that every design evolves, balancing form and function with a human-centered focus.</p>

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>I believe that design is the fusion of form and function—one cannot exist without the other. My work is built on a foundation of creativity and usability, ensuring that every project is both visually compelling and highly functional.</p>

    <p>Through visual storytelling, editorial expertise, and UX/UI innovation, I empower my clients to share their voices and connect with their audiences. Whether through the pages of a book, the flow of a website, or the experience of an app, my designs serve as bridges that bring ideas to life.
    Design is the universal language of connection. Let’s create something that resonates and inspires—together.</p>
