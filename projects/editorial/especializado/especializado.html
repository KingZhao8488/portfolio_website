Project Name:
Specialized Book Design: Mathematics Didactic Material - Methods of Data Analysis
Role:
Editorial Designer
Project Goal:
To design a specialized textbook for university-level mathematics that balances clarity and structure while presenting complex statistical data, tables, and graphs in a visually accessible and cohesive format.
Research:
•	Academic Textbooks: Analyzed successful examples of academic materials to understand effective layouts for technical content.
•	User-Centered Design: Studied the needs of university students and educators, focusing on readability and ease of navigation.
•	Data Visualization: Explored best practices for presenting statistical data, including the use of tables, graphs, and infographics.
Intended Audience:
•	University students studying mathematics, statistics, or data analysis.
•	Professors and educators seeking structured, easy-to-follow didactic material.
•	Academic institutions requiring high-quality, specialized textbooks.
User Testing Results:
The prototype design was reviewed by a group of 10 university students and 5 professors:
•	Positive Feedback:
o	90% found the layout clear and conducive to understanding complex concepts.
o	85% appreciated the clean integration of statistical tables and graphs without overwhelming the content.
•	Suggestions:
o	Increase the use of section dividers for easier navigation.
o	Add subtle color highlights to differentiate between types of data.
Conclusion/Outcome:
The final design achieved a balance between functionality and visual appeal. Key features include:
•	Structured Layout: A grid-based approach ensures that tables, graphs, and text are evenly distributed, creating a logical flow for readers.
•	Typography: Sans-serif fonts were chosen for headings and annotations to maintain clarity, while serif fonts were used for the main text to improve readability during prolonged study sessions.
•	Visual Enhancements: Minimalist color accents were applied sparingly to emphasize key sections and highlight important data without detracting from the overall sobriety of the design.
This project successfully delivered a professional and accessible textbook that supports students in grasping complex mathematical concepts while meeting the rigorous demands of academic publishing.
